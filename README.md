## Overview
Early detection of diabetes can help in timely treatment and better lifestyle management.  
In this project, we:
- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Perform feature analysis and visualization.
- Train multiple ML models.
- Evaluate the models to find the best-performing one for diabetes prediction.

---

## Dataset
We use the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Database** from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) repository.

**Features include:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

**Target:**
- `0` → No Diabetes  
- `1` → Diabetes

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Pandas** – Data handling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML algorithms & evaluation metrics
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-detection-ml.git
   cd diabetes-detection-ml
````

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Run the notebook** `diabetes_detection.ipynb` to:

   * Load the dataset
   * Explore and visualize data
   * Train and evaluate the model

3. **Predict for new data**:
   Modify the prediction cell in the notebook with new patient details.

## Model Training & Evaluation

We experimented with:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

---

## Results

The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy on the test set.
Results may vary depending on preprocessing steps and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## Future Improvements

* Implement deep learning models.
* Build a web application for user-friendly predictions.
* Integrate real-time health data from IoT devices.
* Improve feature engineering for better accuracy.
